Leet code problems solved by Me and friends
You can use these programs to learn. I have used python to solve the problems, its better to solve such problems using high level programming langauage instead of C.
A high level language provides you some of the basic data structure implementations like
1) Dictionary
2) Hash map
3) Link list
4) Stack and Queue
5) etc

So you can focus more on your algorithm instead of how to implement them.
